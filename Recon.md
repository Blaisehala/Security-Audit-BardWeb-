## API Endpoints Map
### Authentication
- POST /api/register/ - Creates new user
- POST /api/login/ - Returns JWT token
[complete this for EVERY endpoint]

## Data Flow Example
"User registers -> receives JWT -> creates task -> task saved with user_id -> user queries their tasks"

## Potential Attack Surface (Initial Thoughts)
- User input points: registration form, login, task creation, search
- Database queries: search functionality looks suspicious
- Authentication: need to test authorization on task endpoints
- File uploads: [if applicable]
